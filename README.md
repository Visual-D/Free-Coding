# Simple Anti-Cheat Script in Lua for Roblox

## Description

This script is a simple anti-cheat system for Roblox games. It monitors players' activities and detects a wide range of possible cheats, such as **speedhack**, **aimbot**, **wallhack**, **teleporthack**, and more.

When a cheat is detected, the script can take action, such as kicking the player from the game.

This system is designed to be easy to integrate into a Roblox game but is also highly customizable to suit the specific needs of the game.

## Features

- **Detection of known cheats**: The script checks for the activation of cheats such as `speedhack`, `aimbot`, `wallhack`, and many others.
- **Automatic Kick**: When a cheat is detected, the player can be automatically kicked from the game.
